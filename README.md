# Water-Quality-Prediction

It's an ML model where water quality is predicted using various algorithms like 'Logistic Regression', 'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest Classifier', 'KNN', 'SVM', 'AdaBoost', 'XGBoost'. The results are analyzed after prediction.

## Model Training
### Data Source 
Water Quality Data - he primary dataset used for this analysis is the " water_potability.csv" file, containing detailed information about water qualtiy means the ph scale , hardness , Turbidity etc.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

###  Bivariate analysis
